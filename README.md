# Description
This is a backup of my customized (see: color changes and custom links) of bastienwirtz' wonderful dashboard [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer).

# Setup

Just `git clone` into `/var/www` and then point your nginx server to `/var/www/dashboards/learn_dash` and `/var/www/dashboards/home_dash`. Logos and links should work by default (reminder that local IP may change for given services). To modify links in either dashboard just modify the appropriate `assets/config.yml`, instructions are included as comments. Logos are available in the `assets/tools` folder.
